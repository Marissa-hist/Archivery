This is a first draft of a working professional website for myself. As an early career librarian, I've been looking for ways to build up my professional online profile and GitHub offers a compelling opportunity to iteratively track my work on this. While this early iteration is simple, it is an opportunity to begin getting comfortable with the basics of Git and GitHub Pages. I've begun to lay out my education, work experience, publications, and professional and community service, and hope to populate the website with my more informal writing, including blog posts.
